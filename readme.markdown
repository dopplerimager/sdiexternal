SDI External
------------

This repo contains the source code and code::blocks project for building the DLL wrapper 
which enables IDL to call routines in external DLL's (the Andor camera, the MOXA driver, 
the USB drivers). Building works with MinGW compiler tools (e.g. http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/).
Both MinGW and code::blocks are free.
